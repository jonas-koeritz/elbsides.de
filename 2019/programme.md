| 09:00 - 13:00 | A         | Elbsides vs. Juice Shop | Björn Kimminich ![Bjoern Kimminich](assets/images/Bjoern-avatar.png) |
|               |           | In this workshop you can test your skills in hacking modern web applications against the OWASP Juice Shop! There are 85+ hacking challenges that are waiting to be solved, ranging from simple functional problems and the usual XSS/SQLi issues over severe authentication flaws up to multi-step and multi-path attacks! | Björn Kimminich is responsible for global IT architecture and application security at Kuehne + Nagel. On the side, he gives IT security lectures at the non-profit private university Nordakademie. Björn also is the project leader of the OWASP Juice Shop and a board member for the German OWASP chapter. |
|               |           | The workshop will consist of multiple short teasers to specific vulnerabilities and lots of time for hacking! You can then stick to the teasered topic or go into free-roaming mode and just try to beat as many challenges as possible. Your pace is entirely up to you! Some of the more mindboggling challenges can optionally be tackled in a "swarm-hacking" style together on the big screen. Over the entire duration of the training you can get first-hand hints by the creator of the Juice Shop in case you get stuck on any challenge.         | Company: Kuehne + Nagel (AG & Co.)
