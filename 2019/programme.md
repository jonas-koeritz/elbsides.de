All presentations will be announced after the [Call for Papers](cfp.html) has closed and the paper selection is done.

## Keynote: The Past, Present, and Future of DNS Resolution ##

* Speaker: [Paul Vixie](#paul-vixie)
* Time: 9:10
* Length: 1h
* Room: Auditorium

The Domain Name System has been a critical enabler of Internet growth
since its inception in 1987. In the decades since then, the DNS
resolution process has evolved from the LAN to the WAN, and to
Anycast; it now includes DNSSEC validation, Extended DNS (EDNS) Client
Subnet, larger message sizes, and I18N. The resolution processs has
also been abused for surveillance, advertising insertion, and
exfiltration. Today the DNS resolution process is poorly understood,
and yet under forced revision. The trend is for DNS to be carried
inside HTTPS where it cannot be monitored or controlled except by
servers and clients themselves, and the dangers this will yield must
be studied and discussed while the future remains flexible. Dr. Vixie
will describe the past and present of DNS, and discuss its likely near
term future.

## Elbsides vs. Juice Shop ##

* Speaker: [Björn Kimminich](#björn-kimminich)
* Time: 9:00-13:00
* Length: 4h
* Room: a

In this workshop you can test your skills in hacking modern
web applications against the OWASP Juice Shop! There are 85+
hacking challenges that are waiting to be solved, ranging from
simple functional problems and the usual XSS/SQLi issues over
severe authentication flaws up to multi-step and multi-path
attacks!

The workshop will consist of multiple short teasers to specific
vulnerabilities and lots of time for hacking! You can then stick
to the teasered topic or go into free-roaming mode and just try to
beat as many challenges as possible. Your pace is entirely up to
you! Some of the more mindboggling challenges can optionally be
tackled in a "swarm-hacking" style together on the big
screen. Over the entire duration of the training you can get
first-hand hints by the creator of the Juice Shop in case you get
stuck on any challenge.

Please bring the following prerequisites to this workshop:

* Laptop with OWASP Juice Shop already installed
* Your favorite Internet browser (obviously not IE)
* Some API testing app like PostMan (optional)
* Any pentesting toys and tools you like (optional)

for BIND from 1989 to 1999, and is the
author of a dozen or so IETF RFC documents about DNS. He also started
the first anti-spam company (MAPS) where he co-invented the DNS RBL
(Realtime Blackhole List) that now protects all e-mail planet-wide,
and was the founder and later president of the first U.S.-based
commercial Internet Exchange (PAIX). Today he serves as CEO of
Farsight Security, home of the Security Information Exchange (SIE) and
the world's leading Passive DNS database (DNSDB). He managed the
F-root DNS server from 1996 to 2012, and wrote the Cron software used
on all UNIX-type computers today. He is also co-inventor of the DNS
Response Rate Limiting (RRL) and Response Policy Zone (RPZ)
feature-sets now in wide use to protect the operational Internet
Domain Name System against online attacks. In 2018, he cofounded
[SIE Europe UG](http://sie-europe.net/), a breakthrough European
data sharing collective to fight cybercrime. He received his Ph.D. from
Keio University in 2011, and was inducted into the Internet Hall of
Fame in 2014.
