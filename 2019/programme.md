# Workshop descriptions #

## Elbsides vs. Juice Shop ##

* Speaker: [Björn Kimminich](#björn-kimminich)
* Time: 9:00-13:00
* Length: 4h
* Room: a

In this workshop you can test your skills in hacking modern
web applications against the OWASP Juice Shop! There are 85+
hacking challenges that are waiting to be solved, ranging from
simple functional problems and the usual XSS/SQLi issues over
severe authentication flaws up to multi-step and multi-path
attacks!

The workshop will consist of multiple short teasers to specific
vulnerabilities and lots of time for hacking! You can then stick
to the teasered topic or go into free-roaming mode and just try to
beat as many challenges as possible. Your pace is entirely up to
you! Some of the more mindboggling challenges can optionally be
tackled in a "swarm-hacking" style together on the big
screen. Over the entire duration of the training you can get
first-hand hints by the creator of the Juice Shop in case you get
stuck on any challenge.

Please bring the following prerequisites to this workshop:

* Laptop with OWASP Juice Shop already installed
* Your favorite Internet browser (obviously not IE)
* Some API testing app like PostMan (optional)
* Any pentesting toys and tools you like (optional)
