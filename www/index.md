## [Sponsors](https://2019.elbsides.de/sponsors.html) ##

Such an event cannot be organized without the support of the community as the admission fee is merely a token amount. So we cannot thank our sponsors enough in making this event possible.

We are currently sponsored by [DFN-CERT](https://www.dfn-cert.de),
[Schutzwerk GmbH ](https://www.schutzwerk.com) and
[BSidesMunich](https://www.bsidesmunich.org), but we need more. See
the [2019 sponsor page](https://2019.elbsides.de/sponsors.html) for
more details.
	
As a community event, we strive to keep admission as low as possible but the fixed costs are high. We are dependent on sponsors to make this event happen.
